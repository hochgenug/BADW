## Branches

One branch per issue named with the following pattern:

* Features: `feature/issue-{id}`

* Bugfixes: `hotfix/issue-{id}` or `bugfix/issue-{id}`

ex: `feature/issue-12`, `hotfix/issue-13`

## Commit messages

# What to do ?

When you commit code changes please always add the related Github issue number in the comment. If it's a bug fix you will always have an issue. If not, please create one.

Some basic rules :

* Keep it short: 50 character should be enough

* Summarize the change: what changed in the commit, avoid editorializing *Be useful: take the time to write something useful, it's time you will spare while reading logs to debug something

* Use English

* Use imperative form (shorter than past form)

A comment template will improve logs readability so you should always use the following pattern:

* `[feature #{id}] commit message`

* `[fix #{id}] commit message`

Or the following version if no ticket is available:

*`[n/a] Project initialization`

ex: `[feature #20] add CONTRIBUTING.md`
